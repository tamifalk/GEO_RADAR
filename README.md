# 📡 GEO Radar — AI Brand Visibility Audit

Streamlit-based tool that audits how top AI models (**ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, **Claude**) answer real insurance-domain questions, and measures whether a target brand (default: **ביטוח ישיר / Direct Insurance**) is mentioned — across answers, sources, and the models' own reasoning.

Built for the **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** hackathon.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-model audit** — Queries 3 live AI models in parallel with grounding/web-search tools enabled.
- **Real citations** — Extracts the actual URLs each model used (not synthetic ones).
- **Thinking transparency** — Surfaces each model's reasoning process and search queries.
- **Brand Audit system prompt** — Forces models to explicitly list which brands they saw in sources vs. which they included in the final answer.
- **🧑‍⚖️ Cross-model judgment** — Claude acts as universal judge, scoring fairness and detecting bias in the other models' answers.
- **📝 Actionable content briefs** — Auto-generates SEO briefs (headline, outline, keywords, recommended platform) per content gap.
- **🆚 Before / After comparison** — Snapshot baseline and measure impact after publishing content.
- **📊 Executive summary** — CEO-level card with "Lost Impressions" estimate and top priority action.
- **Hebrew RTL UI** — Full Hebrew support with branded visuals.
